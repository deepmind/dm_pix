# PIX examples

To run the examples you probably need to install extra requirements. To do so,
use the following `pip` command:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements_examples.txt
```

Then, to run the examples, you can simply run the following commands:

```bash
$ cd examples/
$ python image_augmentation.py
```
You can also view an interactive version of the examples on [Colab](./image_augmentation.ipynb).
